# Introduction about the sensor gy-80:
 The gy-80 is a sensor module consisting of four other smaller sensors which are listed as follows:
 
# Name of the Sensor, Sensor Id and I2C Address

 3 Axis Gyro	                         L3G4200D  	(0x69)	

 3 Axis Accelerometer	            ADXL345     (0x53)	
 
 3 Axis Magnetometer           MC5883L	    (0x1E)	
 
 Barometer + Thermometer    BMP085	    (0x77)	
 
 
 The detailed spesifications of the registers present on the chip of each of the four types of sensors are clearly available in their
 respectibe datasheets. For easier reference kindly refer to the links of the datasheets mentioned below:
